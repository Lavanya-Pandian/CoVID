Building biologically active template against CoVID through molecular fingerprinting analysis'

The current study focuses on utilizing experimentally active compounds reported against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to build effective models that allows in the identification of new leads with similar biological activities against CoVID. A series of compounds with both active and inactive against CoVID is retrieved from PubChem database and filtered through Lipinskiâ€™s rule of 5. Finally, a list of 1453 compounds is utilized for analysis. We employed the use of Morgan circular fingerprint, Daylight-like fingerprint, topological torsion fingerprint and Atom-pair fingerprint to build the template. The data consist of list of parameters, except SMILES and activity data everything else is dropped, exploratory data analysis to remove duplicates and missing values followed by fingerprint generation. The data is further balanced by utilizing ADASYN algorithm (Adaptive Synthetic) algorithm and finger prints are generated. Test and training sets are divided in the ratio of 85:15 and further the training set is divided in 85:15 for validation and finally the models are generated using Logistic Regression and KNN algorithms.
